I Spoke and Demonstrated about "Testing as a Container - Using Docker in Testing" at Selenium Conference 2016 in Bangalore on 24th July 2016.It was awesome speaking in front of large audience full of energy and curiosity.

This Talk was To adopt the mindset of shipping Tests as Containers.All Testers are responsible for reliability of their tests more than developers/dev-ops are responsible for their software.But this is usually difficult,time consuming and needs collaboration with developers but always worth the effort.
we were suppose to evaluate docker capabilities in ensuring and enhancing reliability of our tests.

## Need

We see the below upcoming trends in the world of software delivery.

1.Docker is becoming a standard for managing infrastructure using containers.
2.Testing code and its infrastructure starts to grow at scale with more complexity, dependencies and technology diversity moreover demands better reliability and performance at the same time.

## Agenda

learn how to leverage the container technology to solve the challenges of growing testing infrastructure and continuous delivery with key focus on below items.

* Basics of the containers technology and specifically itâ€™s application on the test automation.
* How Docker can reduce the time of test execution, ease the setup of clean test environments and drastically reduce the differences between the development, acceptance and production environments leading to the higher quality of the released software.
* Examples to containerize entire testing stack together consisting of major automation tools like selenium.
* Integrating and managing testing container with other application containers to achieve easily manageable continuous delivery pipeline.
* Best practices and patterns for docker success.

## Learning Outcome

* Understand Docker, how it works and why its important to testing
* Dockerfile and Multi-container applications with compose
* Packaging your existing tests with selenium(or others) as a portable container
* Examples with selenium tests for taking your projects ahead with docker.
* Integrate containers into a CI pipeline.
