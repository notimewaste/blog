### Recent Dabble

Recently i have started learning react and react-native for web-apps or native mobile apps and as we know that the best way to learn anything is not just to read or watch but to build something from your learnings.

### Purpose
* Cryptocurrency markets are volatile so you need to keep a check on the prices of different Cryptocurrencies but that's very difficult and repetitive.   
* An app to keep users informed of the latest prices different cryptocurrencies in Indian currency on a single screen so that you can take decisions on time and make
more money ðŸ˜Š.
* So Having hit and missed many investment opportunities on cryptocurrencies in last few months all because of not being updated with market prices on the go made me realize that this could be useful to many other cryptocurrency enthusiasts too.
* Kept the name as Cryptocurrently as Crypto + Currently and also being a typo for
  the original term Cryptocurrency

### Why React Native ?

* Was already dabbing with react and In-fact got myself enrolled in Udacity's
  React Nanodegree so hoping to complete by march/april this year.
* Always facinated by the idea of "Learn once, write  anywhere" and building a
  Cross platform app which works on all mobile platforms.
* Javascript - not a big fan of this language but still learning ,let's see ðŸ¤”.
* Over the air deployment suported with React ecosystem ,although haven't tried it for now but will come back to this soon.

### App Features

* It lists the most updated prices of all major cryptocurrencies in INR along with price change from last day and week , all on a single screen.
* that's it for now ðŸ™„.

### Upcoming Features - CryptoCurrently 2.0

* Support for displaying top 100+ cryptocurrencies
* Coin details with history graph
* Multi currency support
* Filter results by rank, price, market change or rating
